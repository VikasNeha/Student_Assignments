I intentionally did not reply on skype so that you realize what happens when one does not just show up. This has happened earlier too but I considered your problem and assigned you further work. And when we needed you to finish some important tasks, YOU were just not available. YOU must understand that we are business and its very difficult to work under such situations. YOU always make false promises. WE had to work double to cover up for you. I dont trust that we can put any responsibilities on you.

I am busy with preparing for the biggest tradeshow. And we will need to take extra time out to discus and assign work to you. I will need to talk to Hassan about the work that we can assign to you. Please do not annoy me or Hassan for a couple of days and we will get back to you. I advise you to be patient until then and sort all your issues so that you are available when we contact you.

 Wishing you best of luck.
